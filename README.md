A board game we invented, requiring just one paper and 2 pencils. Winning will require strategy, patience, and bluff.
We adapted it on python, to allow you to play with someone else in lan.

## The Rules

To start a game you must first create a map, so that every game is unique !

You just take a piece, and place it on the board. 


Coxswain's voice is processed by analog and numerical circuits and encrypted with 128-bit AES before radio transmission. Receiver modules shouldn't be more than 30 meters away from the emitter, which is enough compared to the length of a rowing boat (about 20 meters).

Here is an overview of the inside of each module :

Details about electrical circuits are in [analog](analog) folder. Embedded C codes, radio transmission details and everything digital related are in [digital](digital) folder.
